### This is the Capstone Project from the <i>Python for Data Visualization</i> guided project on Coursera

In this project I will analyze cryptocurrency prices such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH, Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple (XRP).<br>

Datasets are "crypto_daily_prices" and "crypto_daily_returns" provided by the Instructor.
